So, I am a dumb ass, it is known.
And so at school because its the christmas season we did some secret Santa action.
Well I got my gift last, from a person I don't like, I REALLY don't like. He gave me licked dogshit.
In the sense of nothing, not like I said "what the fuck is this bro get more money" or something. I just said a blatant "Thank you" and continued on, but, in my mind I was like:
"Let's get some revenge" See that's where I fucked up worse than I fucked my dog since this guy is a crybaby. He's more than a crybaby, he's a cry MAN. This guy is actively complaining and crying about the things that *slightly* upset him to everyone. So I was still kinda upset even if I knew I just needed to say a blatant "Thank you" and leave it at that.
Well the teachers decided to fuck me in the face and dedicate a entire lesson to drawing something to the person who sent you your gift. I still wanted my revenge so instead of drawing, I did the smart thing, which is writing a story who would make any toddler who can understand english cry. That's the funny part and I wanna shoot myself for forgetting that this guy is a pure fucking toddler.
So I went with it anyways, that's why I myself a dumb ass in the introduction, 
for one, it's a fact.
for two, it's true and I just proved it.
So basically here's the whole story even if it's kinda cringe:
"This was a very beautiful hill, with animals, more exactly cows, sheep, trees and a beautiful sunset until the disaster happened. Night came and a pack of wolves came and ate the cows, but they quickly ran to their hiding spots since it started to rain with acid, which killed the sheep. It also destroyed the trees. Then, the wind started blowing. You see dust particles, water vapors, coming to the left. Then you see it. A tzunami is coming. It destroyed the hill causing it to fall. It's dark. You can't see nothing. Then you realise you're looking at a phone screen. And the image you just saw was a piece of heaven. But all there's left is a dead pixel." I know I know, odd. But he deserved it in my eyes. I didn't deserve the fuck up I'm in now. But because I was at least a bit thankful, I drew him something on the back, with a note saying "Consider this a sign to spend more than 2 bucks and a joke on a gift." Let me quickly explain why I did it.
So all I got in the gift was a chocolate, a night light (which was clearly made in china and cheap asf), but the part I was mad about was a envelope. Which contained a piece of paper. It read:
"Hello (NAME)!
Look very hardly in the envelope and you will see something you really like,
happy secret santa!"
I was pissed. Not only because that got me excited, but also because there was nothing. I expected there at least to be some money. I joked about it with my friend saying it's "filtered air". I clearly knew it was his dead humour because he has nothing to joke about other than his life, of course. But then I went to him and showed him the envelope with nothing in it, saying "Thanks for the filtered air btw" and as I was walking back to my seat he was like complaining about like something, said like "THEY GOT THE PRICES WRONG ON THE NIGHT LIGHT AND IT WAS 10 BUCKS AND MY DAD TOLD ME TO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE", I clearly knew it was a lie. So that was before the lesson I did the drawing. So I know how my teacher executes her students. Not with violence, with something worse. With a session of a quick public shaming, taking of half of the current lesson. So now I go home, school being ended. And so after I show up home, I call my mom since that day I was home alone, suddenly the call goes silent and I hang up. A few minutes later I get another call asking me "What happened at school, my teacher said that the person who I got a gift from was upset." I knew I fucked up in that moment, but what was I supposed to do? Pull a life is strange time-reverse and go back and change what I drew? No, since my dumbass played life is strange he took life as a thing that's idiot proof thinking he can reverse time. Which is bullshit and I cant do anything about it.
So now I have this thing to worry about in the weekend, great, but I ignore it, thinking that my mom is out and I'm fine and dandy. So I hopped in a voice chat with some friends and suddenly, my mom calls me up. Tells me to sit down and explain what I did. I explained that he is basically my arch nemesis and he deserved revenge as he always complains about everything and should learn his lesson, instead I got a "I'm going to send you to a psychologist since if this level of death and disasters is going on in your head then I am a horrible mother and the life you are living is horrible. Which yeah it is but I cant discuss that with your dumb ass since I'm getting double fucked if I tell my mother I make friends online. No way to get out of this other than lie or get a good and valid argument to protect myself of this shithole that's coming to get me.
So what do I do?
Like my mother knows this because my teacher told her and is expecting a call explaining why I DID THIS. I don't know why they discuss this with the parents since we are still minors and we do stupid shit. If we upset another minor then what the fuck are we supposed to do, sue them?
So she tells me she's gonna call her and let US discuss it on monday at school.
I'm totally fucked, first of all I'm not gonna go to a psychologist since if I do i'll get the results of "He's totally fine, idk" by not telling the truth and revealing my whole life. If I do I'm quad-fucked.
And I have nothing to say in my defense. WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?
